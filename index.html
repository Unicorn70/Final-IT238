<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Bryce Valley Kennel is located in beautiful rural southern Utah.  Here at Bryce Valley Kennel we understand how difficult it is to find the Shih Tzu puppy that's right for you.  They are all so adorable.  And with such good looks, and sweet personalities, you just can't help but fall in love with them.</p><br />
<p> All of our Shih Tzu's are well socialized and treated as if they were our own pets. My husband and daughter all play a part in our program with the puppies when they are born.  The puppies are well socialized by the time they go home with their new family.  I cannot even begin to express the joy that our Shih Tzu's brings to our lives. I know that anyone who has ever owned a Shih Tzu knows what I mean. Our little fur babies are family members. Our Shih Tzu's are well groomed and looked after, receiving the love and attention that every pet deserves. We take pride in our hobby and maintain a small kennel so we have plenty of time for each of our Shih Tzu's. We believe a healthy Shih Tzu is a happy Shih Tzu, and a happy Shih Tzu will give their owner years of fun and companionship. Shih Tzu's are an addictive breed.  It is hard to stop when you get one you almost always feel the need for another. A Shih Tzu is a very loving and loyal breed very rarely will you find a Shih Tzu that is not. Shih Tzu's make wonderful companions and lap dogs. When on the computer or watching Television they will want to be on your lap or sitting right next to you.  They also make great traveling companions. Some may even give you the impression that they are 10 feet tall and bullet proof as long as what they are telling off is on the other side of the fence or they are in your arms. Each of the puppies will be well socialized with people and other dogs.</p><br />
 <p>It is a good idea to keep your puppy socialized with other pets as it helps when you want to get a new pet or when visiting someone.  If they stay well socialized and friendly they will most likely always be welcomed back. I don't think that we can say enough about this wonderful breed. If you have any questions regarding our Shih Tzu puppies, or any questions about Shih Tzu's in general feel free to contact us for information.</p><br />
